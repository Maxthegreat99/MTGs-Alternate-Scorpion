# MTGs-Alternate-Scorpion
Max at it again replacing vomit attacks ingame, this mod replaces the current vomit attack of the scorpion with a ranged projectile based one, finally never having to encounter scorpions who's projectiles arkwardly stand in the air due to their spritesheet limitations!

# How to install 
- Clear your game's cache in game settings and uncheck both checkboxes there
- backup your assets folder by creating an archive for it
- download the .zip
- drag the .zip to your game's folder, the one with the .exe (accessible via steam's browse local files option)
- extract the file
- make sure to move the file's asset folder to the same directory where your game's asset folder is located
- overwrite any files it asks to overwrite
- enjoy scorpions who learnt to make usage of their dart's venom

# Credits
- Programming by yours truly 
- [Onilink](http://ic.onidev.fr/en/index.html) who helped me with a lot of the feedback on the projectile (he also kindof made the game)
- spaghettiinabucket who made the projectile, feedback and iterations of the sprites. (":yum:" - Spag after making the sprite of a highly venmous projectile that could kill you)
- Redigit or whatever sound designer there is at Relogic tbh (we used the death sound effect of vile spit for the sound of the projectile)

# The Game
if you dont know Planet Centauri go check it out they just released 1.0, a lot of reviews arent favoring them on steam but mostly because the game has a lot of rough edges and is only made by 2 guys who dedicate their time and money to give us this game. In a few years this game might be absolutely great
